## 📘 Final Notebook Submission
- The final notebook is available [**here**](https://github.com/yifan-grace-tang/final-project/blob/main/Group_6_protein_function_prediction.ipynb).
- We’ve also included most of the data we used under the `'All data files'` directory in the same repository.


##  Overview  
Predicting protein functions—here in the form of **EC numbers**—is critical for understanding metabolic pathways and drug design. This project combines:

- **Sequence information** via [ProtBert](https://huggingface.co/Rostlab/prot_bert) embeddings  
- **Structural data** from AlphaFold‐predicted Cα graphs  
- A **Graph Convolutional Network** (GCN) fused with a sequence‐based MLP  
- A simplified task: **first‐three EC-snippet** classification, single‐label multiclass

## Features  
- **ProteinDataset**:  
  - Fetches/frees caches mmCIF files  
  - Builds residue‐level graphs (8 Å cutoff)  
  - One–hot residue features + ProtBert pooled embeddings  
- **ConvClassifier**:  
  - Two GCN layers + global mean pool  
  - MLP on ProtBert embedding  
  - Fusion head → predicting three‐level EC classes  
- **Notebook**: End‐to‐end demo (`mlcb_project.ipynb`)

Many previous works developed computational methods that utilize protein sequence information to predict protein functions. With the advancement of `AlphaFold2`, accurate protein structure data has been available for hundreds of millions of proteins.\n","\n","Incorporating structure information should be able to further boost the performance of protein function prediction methods. There are several potential ways to utilize the structure information: use computer-vision-like models to extract information from contact maps; use graph neural networks to encode 3D structures; use pretrained protein structure model (e.g., `ESM-IF`).\n","\n","In addition, with the advancement of LLMs, the text annotations of proteins can also be leveraged as an extra information source for protein function prediction, e.g., use LLM as encoder to encode the text annotations of proteins. Utilizing the information from sequence, structure, and text annotations, we can develop a model that accurately predicts protein functions.\n","\n","__Using a subset of the dataset used for [DeepFRI](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/DeepFRI) (a similar protein function prediction model) we aim to coallesce sequence data and structure data to predict protein function in the form of [EC Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_Commission_number).__\n","\n","[[1]](ttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.29.518451v1), [[2]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-024-07359-z), [[3]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23303-9), [[4]](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.14.594226v1 )\n"],"metadata":{"id":"dHJe_PL6ooeo"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Methodology\n","\n","> _This section relies on having_ `annotations.tsv`, `train.txt`, `validation.txt`, _and_ `sequences.fasta` _in your runtime_\n","\n","We need a model that turns raw protein sequences into one or more EC numbers. Our goal is simplicity, speed, and the ability to predict multiple functions per protein.\n","\n","__Embedding:__\n","\n","We map each amino acid to a **128-dimensional vector** via a small, learnable embedding layer.  \n","  - Captures key sequence patterns  without the heavy storage or compute of large pre-trained models.  \n","  - Fits comfortably in GPU memory when training on ~15,000 proteins.\n","\n","__Pooling:__\n","\n","We apply **masked mean pooling** to average embeddings across the sequence.  \n","  - Converts variable-length sequences into fixed-size fingerprints.  \n","  - Ensures padding tokens do not skew the average, keeping representations true to the real residues.\n","\n","__Model Architecture:__\n","\n","A simple two-layer feedforward network with a 256-unit hidden layer and 50% dropout.  \n","  - Two layers os enough capacity to learn interactions between sequence features, but not so deep as to overfit.  \n","  - Dropout promotes generalization by preventing reliance on any single feature.\n","\n","Each EC category is a separate output node with a sigmoid activation, trained using binary cross-entropy.  \n","  - Proteins can carry **multiple EC numbers**.  \n","  - Independent sigmoids allow the model to assign all applicable ECs without forcing a single choice.\n","\n","__Training:__\n","\n","- **Loss:** `BCEWithLogitsLoss` for multi-label

Steps:__\n","\n","- **Threshold Calibration:** Use validation data to pick optimal probability cutoffs for each EC.  \n","- **Feature Extensions:** Add graphical information from a contact map into the embedding __and__ pick a less expensive sequence embedding approach then `ESM` to do the sequence embeddings.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"D9-0TiBuCrpy"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import
